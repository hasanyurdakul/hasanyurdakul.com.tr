Built a platform using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Express, Render, and Cloudinary to turn prompts into images via the OpenAI API.

Utilizing a techstack of React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Express, Render, and Cloudinary to create a platform where users can turn prompts into images using the OpenAI API.

I aimed to provide a seamless experience, allowing users to input their creative prompts and receive visually captivating images generated through the OpenAI API.

With Next.js for server-side rendering and React for dynamic front-end interactions, this application promises speed and responsiveness. Tailwind CSS streamlines UI development, while MongoDB handles data storage and Express manages server-side operations. Leveraging Render for deployment and Cloudinary for image hosting, scalability and reliability are prioritized.
