            I didn't know I would love travelling so much until back in 2017
            December when I first decided to do a solo to Udaipur. It was my
            first time out alone and god I felt scared but excited at the same
            time. After that trip to Udaipur I realized how travelling can add
            to your life in terms of knowledge, meeting new people and
            perspective. You meet people, talk to them and share experiences,
            cultures, ideas which is a big thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other aspect of travelling that I love is capturing moments, and
            that helped me up my photography game a bit. You can head over to my{" "}
            <a href="https://instagram.com/hhasanyurdakul">Instagram</a> or{" "}
            <a href="http://unsplash.com/@rishi">Unsplash</a> to check some of
            the photos I've taken while exploring beautiful destinations. Lakes,
            the mountains, greenery and the clouds in the sky, scenes that you
            don't get to see on a regular day is what I like to capture.

            I've created this page to visualize all the locations I've been so
            far.
